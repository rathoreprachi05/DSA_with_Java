/*Question: Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator (such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5).

Examples: 

*) Input: x = 4 → Output: 2

*) Input: x = 8 → Output: 2 (since the true sqrt ≈ 2.828…, floor is 2)
